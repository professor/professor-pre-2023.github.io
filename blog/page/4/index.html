  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every group of students is different and has it&rsquo;s own &ldquo;feel&rdquo; &mdash; sometimes they are connected, energized, quiet, inquisitive. It may not be obvious what it is until the next group of students come and I realize that I like some aspects of the new group and miss some aspects of the older group(s).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been following a particular group of students through a curriculum and I know that they are &ldquo;quieter&rdquo; than previous groups. In the past, my attitude has been, &ldquo;if they don&rsquo;t want to discuss this, that&rsquo;s ok, we&rsquo;ll move on, or we&rsquo;ll end early.&rdquo; However, I&rsquo;m challenging myself to try a different approach with the goal of raising my game and being a better teacher.</p>

<p>Main idea: prose a question to the group and have each person answer it on a sheet of paper. Put all the sheets into a hat. Select one member randomly (I like to use my fire dice) and have them draw the question from the hat. That person then leads a conversation around what was written on the paper. Note: you can have the students write questions on the paper, if this is the case, the person drawing the sheet out of the hat is not responsible for answering the question, they are responsible for getting the group to answer the question.</p>

<h2>Possible Questions</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my initial brainstorm list for possible questions for the group:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are some fears you have about this class?</li>
<li>What is software craftsmanship?</li>
<li>Who is a software role model for you and why?</li>
<li>What are you strong in, how did this happen, and how can you continue to improve?</li>
<li>What is something that you want to work more on? How will you improve, how will you know if you are successful?</li>
<li>What is necessary to become an expert?</li>
</ul>


<h2>The technique in action</h2>

<p>I choose this question for the students.
&ldquo;What are some of your concerns about this course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here are their answers.
* regain lost powers in terms of java programming (covered)
* finding a good mentor (covered)
* mentor does not agree to coach
* I fear running out of ideas for learning areas I wish to improve
* getting too caught up in the course
* first time the course is offered, so it might not work out as planned
* how much will it help me in the long run?
* didn&rsquo;t have any real fears up until you mentioned it!
* one fear is not meeting my goals at the end of the semester.
I allowed a student to lead a discussion about the selected slip of paper. The class and I had a great conversation about the student&rsquo;s concern and what were some things to deal with it. I found this approach to be more engaging than going through a syllabus.
After using this technique for a course, I noticed that most of my students didn&rsquo;t meet my expectations for a facilitator. Some would jump into giving their own answer. Others would ask a very good opening question, but then not probe for great details. In these situations when the student stopped leading, I would ask more detailed questions and explore subtle nuances.</p>

<p>All in all, I really enjoyed using this technique.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I must be having the butterfly jitters before offering a new course, Special Topics Seminar: Craft of Software Development. I sat down with a google document to review everything that I wanted to do with the course. In a moment of feeling that I must have been missing something, I reviewed my original blog post about the idea. To my surprise, the ideas in my original blog post were consistent with my current ideas and still at the heart of the course design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using Keith Johnstone as an inspiration for this course. While I have some course structure, I want to be flexible with the delivery and reflect after each session on how the course can be better serving this particular group of students. I&rsquo;m also wanting to try some crazy in class exercises. At times, I feel that actors getting on stage is an easier art form to work with than software developers writing code. Perhaps I&rsquo;d feel differently if everyone would be working with the same programming language.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/TalkAgenda.jpg" border=0><img src="/images/TalkAgenda.jpg" width="75%" alt=""/></a></p>

<p>I tried an experimental presentation technique today, which I call &ldquo;Sitemap Presentation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was asked to do the talk &ldquo;Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Silicon Valley&rdquo; for Carnegie Mellon University at the Pittsburgh campus, I drew out on paper my talk outline. My drawing reminded me of Kent Beck&rsquo;s notes when he was presenting at Rails Conf 2008 (?) &mdash; its much like his drawings at the beginning of his book.</p>

<p>When I was creating the slides, I wanted the ability to hop around to different parts of my presentation. Yes, I could do one ordering of the topics, but I wanted to be flexible with my talk and respond to what the audience wanted. So I scanned in my diagram and used the diagram as my agenda slide. I duplicated the diagram throughout the presentation. I found that the drawing was more to my liking. I&rsquo;ve never been fond of doing an agenda slide, they always feel so boring, but this really livened it up and allowed me to see quickly where we were headed.</p>

<p>In my ideal version, each part of the sitemap would be clickable. Thus I&rsquo;d have a title slide followed by an agenda slide. Whenever I clicked anywhere on my diagram, it would go off on that thread and then return to the agenda slide. If I clicked on a different part of the agenda, it would take on a different thread. I&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to do this in powerpoint / keynote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What if regular expressions were easy to write?</p>

<p>While attending the Golden Gate Ruby Conference 2010, I attended a session about Arel and how Rails was changing their ORM layer to make it easier to incrementally build the query.</p>

<p>Old: Article.find(:all, :order => &ldquo;published_at desc&rdquo;, :limit => 10)</p>

<p>New: Article.order(&ldquo;published_at desc&rdquo;).limit(10)</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this concept of simplifying could be applied to regular expression.</p>

<p>While I have time, I&rsquo;ll continue to build up examples of what the syntax could look like.</p>

<p>Random thoughts:</p>

<p>What: not a number</p>

<ul>
<li>ie a string that can&rsquo;t be convert to a number</li>
<li>A string that contains at least on character</li>
<li>Regex: /^.<em>\D+.</em>$/</li>
<li>Positive examples: 113t23io10908-113</li>
<li>Negative examples: 13431</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Postgresql doesn&rsquo;t marshal data types like MySQL does. For many of my tables, I store year as an INTEGER. In one of my tables, when I did the migration, I specified it as a VARCHAR. This generated this error.</p>

<p>PGError: ERROR: operator does not exist: character varying = integer\nLINE 1: &hellip;n_id = u.id)</p>

<p>Solving it was pretty simple. In my development and production databases I did the following commands. Then did a new data push to heroku&rsquo;s postresql database.</p>

<p>1) Create another column using the MySQL Administrator GUI tool. Ie year2 of type INTEGER</p>

<p>2) Run the following command from MySQL Query Browser &ldquo;update courses set year2 = year&rdquo;</p>

<p>3) Drop the column year.</p>

<p>4) Rename column year2 to be year.5) heroku db:push mysql:&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Experiment with full time students this summer to explore this topic.</p>

<p>In a language and framework of their choice, have students select a short project to build, ie a blog website, or twitter client mobile application. Include testing. In the first session, build the project. (Time it.) Repeat again. Repeat again. Repeat again. After each session reflect on what you learned. Was there insights about the IDE? Where there key command short cuts? Do your test cases get better from defects from previous sessions, or do they get worse because of short cuts? Is there an aspect of the technology that you are deficient in that requires additional practice? (Katana example) Look for trends across the student population.</p>

<p>Based upon trends across the student population, identify further areas of practice.</p>

<p>Try same experiment with paired programming.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans</a></p>

<p>Inspiration: improv &ndash; learning scene work or singing a song from scratch. Take an impossible task and break into small concrete steps. Slowly build upon the steps to reach the goal. Sometimes explore the concept of each step with positive and negative examples.</p>

<p>Inspiration: Katana for TDD</p>

<p>Inspiration: Learning to play the piano. Strength building exercises. The whole point of the exercise is to build up . Much like dance where there are patterns, technique and skill aspects to a class. The patterns make learning dancing fun and motivate the student to keep going. Playing a song is rewarding. Working on skill is tedious but makes the fun stuff more accessible and easier to accomplish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My university uses Google Apps for Universities. We wanted users to be able to authenticate to our rails application using their Google Apps account. Since Google Apps now supports openid, I thought that this would be really straightforward. A friend had just installed openid on his site and it was a breeze. I thought I would just install a few gems and get on with other rails development activities. I have no intention of becoming an openid expert. Here are the steps that I followed to get it to all work together.</p>

<p>Step 1) Enable Federated Login using OpenID on your Google Apps domain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/">http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/</a>{your-domain}/SetupIdp</p>

<p>Step 2) Download your needed gems</p>

<p>a) gem install ruby-openid
This is JanRan&rsquo;s ruby implementation of open id</p>

<p>b) gem install ruby-openid-apps-discovery
This is Google&rsquo;s extension of ruby-openid to work with Google Apps</p>

<p>c) gem install rack-openid
This is a rack wrapper around JanRan&rsquo;s open id</p>

<p>d) ./script/plugin install git://github.com/rails/open_id_authentication.git
This is Rails code to make integrating in with open id easier</p>

<p>e) Modify config/environment.erb and add this line
require &lsquo;gapps_openid&rsquo;</p>

<p>Step 3) Add some code to your rails application.</p>

<p>If you get a warning message like this

<p>The fix is pretty simple.
a) In your config/environment.rb file add the line
OpenID.fetcher.ca_file = &ldquo;#{Rails.root}/config/ca-bundle.crt&rdquo;
b) You&rsquo;ll need to get a ca-bundle.crt file. You should add in certificate authorities that you trust. If you are in a hurry, you can use the one in the ruby-openid-apps-discovery gem. Unpack it and find it in the lib directory. I copied mine to my application&rsquo;s config directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you do legitimate cross site scripting?</p>

<p>If you control the servers involved, this is how you can do cross site scripting with AJAX.</p>

<p>I recently came across a situation where I wanted to do an AJAX load from one server to another server. Internally to our campus, our students use a wiki and a ruby on rails web application. I wanted information contained in our rails application to show up on the wiki. My first impulse was to use jquery&rsquo;s load method, however, I received the following error:</p>

<p><red>Access to restricted URI denied&#8221; code: &ldquo;1012</red></p>

<p>My first work around is just to avoid the AJAX load and use an iframe. However, inspiration hit me a few weeks ago and I tried a different solution. Since the AJAX load can retrieve information from the same website, maybe I should request a special url on the same machine and use apache to hide the fact that the content is coming from a different domain name. This can be accomplished with the apache ProxyPass command.</p>

<p>Let me give a concrete example. Say you have two websites: a static site that serves html pages through apache from the filesystem (<a href="http://static.sv.cmu.edu">http://static.sv.cmu.edu</a>) and a dynamic site using an application server with a database (<a href="http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu">http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu</a>). You want some of the information from the dynamic site to show up on the static site. You want to allow users to add comments to a static webpage where the comments are rendered by the dynamic site.
Your first attempt might be:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$('#comments').load('http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments');</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which results in the error.
In static.sv.cmu.edu&rsquo;s httpd.conf file add the following line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ProxyPass /comments http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now from your browser window, test to see if you can access the dynamic data from the static machine: <a href="http://static.sv.cmu.edu/comments">http://static.sv.cmu.edu/comments</a> should give you the same information as would <a href="http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments">http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments</a>
Now your AJAX code will work.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js">&lt;/script>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript">
</span><span class='line'> //&lt;![CDATA[
</span><span class='line'>$(document).ready(function(){
</span><span class='line'> $('#comments').load('http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments');
</span><span class='line'>});
</span><span class='line'>//]]>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/script></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to any Agile Maturity Model (AMM), it is paramount to start with the business value with respect to the framework. The framework should clearly identify the business and software engineering issues it is trying to solve.</p>

<p>The framework should be simple to understand. It&rsquo;s essence should be straightforward. Practitioners should be able to start applying the concepts and see progress. Days of training should not be a pre-requisite for adoption.</p>

<p>I am very reluctant to place any named method into different defined levels, unless the analysis is multi-dimentional. Let me be concrete. When an IBM employee identifies RUP as a Level 2 method and Scrum and XP as Level 1 methods, it is an open invitation for skeptics to find immediate cause to reject the maturity model as biased toward company loyalism. This is not to say that we should not compare and contrast different methods. Larman compares methods by ceremony and cycle while Cockburn scale&rsquo;s uses team size and criticality to determine a version of Crystal to use.</p>
