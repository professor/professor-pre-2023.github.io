  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/images/TalkAgenda.jpg" border=0><img src="/images/TalkAgenda.jpg" width="75%" alt=""/></a></p>

<p>I tried an experimental presentation technique today, which I call &ldquo;Sitemap Presentation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I was asked to do the talk &ldquo;Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Silicon Valley&rdquo; for Carnegie Mellon University at the Pittsburgh campus, I drew out on paper my talk outline. My drawing reminded me of Kent Beck&rsquo;s notes when he was presenting at Rails Conf 2008 (?) &mdash; its much like his drawings at the beginning of his book.</p>

<p>When I was creating the slides, I wanted the ability to hop around to different parts of my presentation. Yes, I could do one ordering of the topics, but I wanted to be flexible with my talk and respond to what the audience wanted. So I scanned in my diagram and used the diagram as my agenda slide. I duplicated the diagram throughout the presentation. I found that the drawing was more to my liking. I&rsquo;ve never been fond of doing an agenda slide, they always feel so boring, but this really livened it up and allowed me to see quickly where we were headed.</p>

<p>In my ideal version, each part of the sitemap would be clickable. Thus I&rsquo;d have a title slide followed by an agenda slide. Whenever I clicked anywhere on my diagram, it would go off on that thread and then return to the agenda slide. If I clicked on a different part of the agenda, it would take on a different thread. I&rsquo;ll have to figure out how to do this in powerpoint / keynote.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What if regular expressions were easy to write?</p>

<p>While attending the Golden Gate Ruby Conference 2010, I attended a session about Arel and how Rails was changing their ORM layer to make it easier to incrementally build the query.</p>

<p>Old: Article.find(:all, :order => &ldquo;published_at desc&rdquo;, :limit => 10)</p>

<p>New: Article.order(&ldquo;published_at desc&rdquo;).limit(10)</p>

<p>It occurred to me that this concept of simplifying could be applied to regular expression.</p>

<p>While I have time, I&rsquo;ll continue to build up examples of what the syntax could look like.</p>

<p>Random thoughts:</p>

<p>What: not a number</p>

<ul>
<li>ie a string that can&rsquo;t be convert to a number</li>
<li>A string that contains at least on character</li>
<li>Regex: /^.<em>\D+.</em>$/</li>
<li>Positive examples: 113t23io10908-113</li>
<li>Negative examples: 13431</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Postgresql doesn&rsquo;t marshal data types like MySQL does. For many of my tables, I store year as an INTEGER. In one of my tables, when I did the migration, I specified it as a VARCHAR. This generated this error.</p>

<p>PGError: ERROR: operator does not exist: character varying = integer\nLINE 1: &hellip;n_id = u.id)</p>

<p>Solving it was pretty simple. In my development and production databases I did the following commands. Then did a new data push to heroku&rsquo;s postresql database.</p>

<p>1) Create another column using the MySQL Administrator GUI tool. Ie year2 of type INTEGER</p>

<p>2) Run the following command from MySQL Query Browser &ldquo;update courses set year2 = year&rdquo;</p>

<p>3) Drop the column year.</p>

<p>4) Rename column year2 to be year.5) heroku db:push mysql:&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Experiment with full time students this summer to explore this topic.</p>

<p>In a language and framework of their choice, have students select a short project to build, ie a blog website, or twitter client mobile application. Include testing. In the first session, build the project. (Time it.) Repeat again. Repeat again. Repeat again. After each session reflect on what you learned. Was there insights about the IDE? Where there key command short cuts? Do your test cases get better from defects from previous sessions, or do they get worse because of short cuts? Is there an aspect of the technology that you are deficient in that requires additional practice? (Katana example) Look for trends across the student population.</p>

<p>Based upon trends across the student population, identify further areas of practice.</p>

<p>Try same experiment with paired programming.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans</a></p>

<p>Inspiration: improv &ndash; learning scene work or singing a song from scratch. Take an impossible task and break into small concrete steps. Slowly build upon the steps to reach the goal. Sometimes explore the concept of each step with positive and negative examples.</p>

<p>Inspiration: Katana for TDD</p>

<p>Inspiration: Learning to play the piano. Strength building exercises. The whole point of the exercise is to build up . Much like dance where there are patterns, technique and skill aspects to a class. The patterns make learning dancing fun and motivate the student to keep going. Playing a song is rewarding. Working on skill is tedious but makes the fun stuff more accessible and easier to accomplish.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My university uses Google Apps for Universities. We wanted users to be able to authenticate to our rails application using their Google Apps account. Since Google Apps now supports openid, I thought that this would be really straightforward. A friend had just installed openid on his site and it was a breeze. I thought I would just install a few gems and get on with other rails development activities. I have no intention of becoming an openid expert. Here are the steps that I followed to get it to all work together.</p>

<p>Step 1) Enable Federated Login using OpenID on your Google Apps domain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/">http://www.google.com/a/cpanel/</a>{your-domain}/SetupIdp</p>

<p>Step 2) Download your needed gems</p>

<p>a) gem install ruby-openid
This is JanRan&rsquo;s ruby implementation of open id</p>

<p>b) gem install ruby-openid-apps-discovery
This is Google&rsquo;s extension of ruby-openid to work with Google Apps</p>

<p>c) gem install rack-openid
This is a rack wrapper around JanRan&rsquo;s open id</p>

<p>d) ./script/plugin install git://github.com/rails/open_id_authentication.git
This is Rails code to make integrating in with open id easier</p>

<p>e) Modify config/environment.erb and add this line
require &lsquo;gapps_openid&rsquo;</p>

<p>Step 3) Add some code to your rails application.</p>

<p>If you get a warning message like this

<p>The fix is pretty simple.
a) In your config/environment.rb file add the line
OpenID.fetcher.ca_file = &ldquo;#{Rails.root}/config/ca-bundle.crt&rdquo;
b) You&rsquo;ll need to get a ca-bundle.crt file. You should add in certificate authorities that you trust. If you are in a hurry, you can use the one in the ruby-openid-apps-discovery gem. Unpack it and find it in the lib directory. I copied mine to my application&rsquo;s config directory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How do you do legitimate cross site scripting?</p>

<p>If you control the servers involved, this is how you can do cross site scripting with AJAX.</p>

<p>I recently came across a situation where I wanted to do an AJAX load from one server to another server. Internally to our campus, our students use a wiki and a ruby on rails web application. I wanted information contained in our rails application to show up on the wiki. My first impulse was to use jquery&rsquo;s load method, however, I received the following error:</p>

<p><red>Access to restricted URI denied&#8221; code: &ldquo;1012</red></p>

<p>My first work around is just to avoid the AJAX load and use an iframe. However, inspiration hit me a few weeks ago and I tried a different solution. Since the AJAX load can retrieve information from the same website, maybe I should request a special url on the same machine and use apache to hide the fact that the content is coming from a different domain name. This can be accomplished with the apache ProxyPass command.</p>

<p>Let me give a concrete example. Say you have two websites: a static site that serves html pages through apache from the filesystem (<a href="http://static.sv.cmu.edu">http://static.sv.cmu.edu</a>) and a dynamic site using an application server with a database (<a href="http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu">http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu</a>). You want some of the information from the dynamic site to show up on the static site. You want to allow users to add comments to a static webpage where the comments are rendered by the dynamic site.
Your first attempt might be:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$('#comments').load('http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments');</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Which results in the error.
In static.sv.cmu.edu&rsquo;s httpd.conf file add the following line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>ProxyPass /comments http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now from your browser window, test to see if you can access the dynamic data from the static machine: <a href="http://static.sv.cmu.edu/comments">http://static.sv.cmu.edu/comments</a> should give you the same information as would <a href="http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments">http://dynamic.sv.cmu.edu/comments</a>
Now your AJAX code will work.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js">&lt;/script>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;script type="text/javascript">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it comes to any Agile Maturity Model (AMM), it is paramount to start with the business value with respect to the framework. The framework should clearly identify the business and software engineering issues it is trying to solve.</p>

<p>The framework should be simple to understand. It&rsquo;s essence should be straightforward. Practitioners should be able to start applying the concepts and see progress. Days of training should not be a pre-requisite for adoption.</p>

<p>I am very reluctant to place any named method into different defined levels, unless the analysis is multi-dimentional. Let me be concrete. When an IBM employee identifies RUP as a Level 2 method and Scrum and XP as Level 1 methods, it is an open invitation for skeptics to find immediate cause to reject the maturity model as biased toward company loyalism. This is not to say that we should not compare and contrast different methods. Larman compares methods by ceremony and cycle while Cockburn scale&rsquo;s uses team size and criticality to determine a version of Crystal to use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the first keynote for SD West 2009 conference held in Santa Clara, CA, USA, Robert Martin (aka Uncle Bob) reflected on the history of the Agile movement, both what Extreme Programming and Scrum have done for the industry, and the need for Software Craftsmanship</p>

<p>Ten years ago, Extreme Programming had just arrived on the scene. People&rsquo;s reactions were either excitement or revulsion. Programmers who suffered under heavy weight processes rejoiced that they could get work done. The method has a high geek factor as it gave specific guidelines on programming and testing. This made it appealing to programmers but made it difficult for project managers or businessmen to get excited about it. Those who revulsed complained that without architecture and a thorough design, the software would become a mess. Because of these two reactions, Extreme Programming received a lot of attention.</p>

<p>After the birth of the agile manifesto at the Snowbird, Utah meeting, there were some unintended consequences. One was finding a better term to describe the new &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; methods, and the term &ldquo;agile&rdquo; stuck. The success of adoption was beyond what they were expecting. Another interesting consequences was the new attention given to scrum.</p>

<p>Scrum is a near perfect subset of the Extreme Programming practices. It has the many of the same project management practices (Small Releases, Release Planning, Acceptance Tests, Whole Team, Product Owner) without the technical practices (Refactoring, Simple Design, Test Driven Development, Continuous Build, Paired Programming). In short, it doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;smell&rdquo; of geeks. Scrum made agile palatable to business people. The scrum certification process allowed agile to cross the chasm as scrum became mainstream.</p>

<p>What got left behind were the engineering disciplines or &ldquo;software craftsmanship.&rdquo; With scrum, you can turn the iteration crank very quickly, yet over time, the crank can get harder to turn as a mess begins to emerge. The nay-sayers of XP were correct in this regard, without replacing architecture and design with technical practices, you do get a mess. Now there is emerging talk of craftsmanship. People are using Katas to study how to write software. They write the same piece of software over and over again to learn technical mastery of software. Last Friday, the Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship was released. Robert ended his keynote with a plug for his Clean Code book and a green Clean Code bracelet that helps remind you to leave the world of code a better place by improving each module you come across.</p>
