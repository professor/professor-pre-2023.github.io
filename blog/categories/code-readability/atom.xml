    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m working with 21 developers to improve their code readability. Through a code read-through, they listen to another developer try and read their code. (See <a href="" title="http://sedano.org/journal/2011/3/30/code-readability-process.html">Code Readability Process</a> for more details.)</p>

<p>In reviewing one programmer&rsquo;s code, a sixty line method had a visual rhythm to it. There would be a blank space, a comment, then about ten lines of code, and the cycle would repeat. The comment would explained the code just following it.</p>

<p>The programmer realizes that the narrative is lost in their code, and feels compelled to add these comments to help the reader understand what is going on. These comments serve as section breaks or chapter headings.</p>

<p>Instead, the code could be split up into smaller methods, where each method name would clearly revel the intent of the code. The comment would be better served as a method invocation.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the pattern</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>//determine interest rate  (comment about the code intention)
</span><span class='line'>code
</span><span class='line'>code
</span><span class='line'>code</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Becomes</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;/p>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;pre>&lt;code>determine_interest_rate()
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;p></span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the original code</p>

<p>(Note that I have not shown other refactoring that I would do, as it would distract from the point.)</p>

<p>By changing the comment to a method call, the code is now more &ldquo;self documenting&rdquo; and the intent is clear by the method call.</p>

<p>When I suggested this to the programmer, she resisted the idea noting that a method call would affect performance. For a tic-tac-toe problem, this is a specious argument. However, is there merit to it? Will a modern compiler optimize this kind of refactoring? And this brings up a broader question, should we optimize code for performance or readability when we are writing it? Conventional wisdom says we should write code that is clean and easy to understand, and when we are done and have performance analysis with production data, then we know where to spend engineering effort to optimize critical sections. The one exception would be algorithm complexity and running times. (e.g. O(N) vs O(NxN)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now curious, is this a &ldquo;comment smell&rdquo;? Can comments be indicators to us programmers that the code we just wrote isn&rsquo;t very clear. The comment itself my inform us on how we need to refactor the code to make it more readable.</p>

    <updated>2011-03-30T19:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://professor.github.io/toddsedano/2011/03/30/code-readability-process</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>As software developers, we want to create clean code, code that is easy for other software developers to read. Ironically, we often don&rsquo;t receive much feedback on our code when we are writing it. Some companies will do code reviews, and the code review feedback may help us write clean code, but we may not understand how other developers are confused. This process allows the programmer to see first hand, what is causing another developer difficulty when they read the code.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Preparation) There are two roles, a Programmer (someone who has created code) and a Reader (someone who will review provided code). I am an observer of the process.</p>

<p>The Programmer will select recent production code that they have produced. I do not need to see the code and would prefer not to see it. I&rsquo;d prefer for you to select the most recent code you have created because then you won&rsquo;t be tempted to pick &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; or &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; code. We&rsquo;re just looking for typical code and presumably whatever you wrote recently is typical.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll prompt the Reader with some open ended questions. The job of the Programmer is to simply receive the feedback.</p>

<p>Step 1) Programmer, provide some context by explaining the user story (or story card) behind the code. Describe the requirements at a high level in business terms. The Reader should have some notion of the problem the Programmer was trying to solve and the added business value.</p>

<p>Step 2) Reader, read through the code and think out lowd about your initial reaction and your thought process for understanding the code. If things are clear, mention that. If something is confusing, mention the questions that you are thinking. Reason outlowd. There are no wrong answers, this is an opportunity for the Programmer to see how another developer interacts with their code. Provide them with your first impressions.</p>

<p>Do this until you&rsquo;ve walked through the code and think you understand it.</p>

<p>Step 3) Programmer, thank the Reader for their invaluable input. Please just say &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; &mdash; there is no need to defend your code</p>

<p>Step 4) Reader, do you see ways to refactor the code? Are there opportunities to make it more dry?</p>

<p>Step 5) Reader, if the Programmer left the company and you had to maintain this code, could you do it?</p>

<p>Step 6) Programmer, are there any clarifying questions that you have for the Reader about their comments? (For example, is there something may be very clear to you, but wasn&rsquo;t clear to the Reader. This is your opportunity to better understand how you could make it more clear.)</p>

<p>Step 7) Programmer, reflect on this experience and describe what was the most useful aspect of it?</p>

<p>Step 8) Programmer, was this worth your time?</p>

<p>Step 9) Programmer, please fill in the survey response to this exercise</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>While teaching &ldquo;the craft of software development&rdquo; to my masters students, one of my students wanted to write more readable code. I challenged each student to come up with metrics to see if they were improving. The student couldn&rsquo;t think of any. I realized that he would need to show his code to another developer to find out if the code was readable. He could track the feedback as a metric as seen in the comic: <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m">http://www.osnews.com/story/19266/WTFs_m</a></p>
