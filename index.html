  <div class="entry-content"><p>Title: The illusion of requirements; the requirements myth</p>

<p>&ldquo;Requirements&rdquo; is a pre-agile construct based on our false belief that building software was somehow like the construction of buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Requirements&rdquo; limits the development team into thinking the end product is fixed and that the team&rsquo;s goal is to implement a specification.</p>

<p>Agile development teams expect features to change over time. Even with thorough user research and validation, the product will change as soon as we receive user feedback. Even during the implementation of a user story, an emergent conversation on the team might change its acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>In contrast, features are a construct of preferences. Many preferences may stay the same, some will change over time, and most are made up on the spot <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/id/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/construction-preference">Lichtenstein and Slovic 2006</a>.</p>

<h2>A simple example</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a simple and common feature request: &ldquo;the user logs into the system with a username and password.&rdquo; If we consider this request to be fixed, we might not consider alternative solutions.</p>

<ul>
<li> Some websites support magic links. You don’t type in a password, the system emails you an authentication link.</li>
<li> Some websites require two-factor authentication.</li>
<li> Some websites rely on a third-party single sign-on such as Google, Facebook, or Okta.</li>
</ul>


<p>Several of these solutions also attempt to solve the problem of users creating easy to guess or easy to break passwords.</p>

<p>Treating authentication as a &ldquo;requirement&rdquo; misses these opportunities.</p>

<h2>System characteristics</h2>

<p>How then do we deal with performance, scalability, availability, recoverability?</p>

<p>Pre-agile has the notion of &ldquo;non-functional requirements&rdquo; which describe system characteristics or product quality characteristics.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>Before agile, I wrote my share of statements like &ldquo;the web page should load in under 0.5 seconds.&rdquo; In reflection, my non-functional &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; were arbitrary limitations on the system.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the typical workflow for agile software development.
   * Conduct user research and validation to determine appropriate feature for the opportunity
   * Build a minimal implementation of the feature
   * Verify that the feature matches the opportunity, if not iterate
   * Improve performance where needed
This is a variant of &ldquo;Make it work, make it right, make it fast.&rdquo;(<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization">http://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization</a>)</p>

<h3>Availability and Recoverability</h3>

<p>Many of the system characteristics such as availability can influence Service Level Agreements. Pre-agile treats these as guarantees. If we build the system just right, we can guarantee that we will achieve a particular outcome. Agile treats these as goals. If we want to prove ourselves that the system handles disruptions, then we introduce disruptions much like Netflix Chaos Monkey. We keep iterating on the product and deployment process until we achieve the goal. Adding Chaos Monkey to a system could be considered a &ldquo;non-functional story&rdquo; or a chore, since it provides no user facing functionality yet improves the product&rsquo;s quality.</p>

<h2>Avoid pre-agile constructs</h2>

<p>It can be hard to remove bias from pre-agile constructs. If you see yourself or your team using the following words, pause and reconsider your options:
   * specifications,
   * requirements,
   * the system shall&hellip;</p>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Avoid limiting yourself with pre-agile concepts. Recognize the flexibility of features in building software.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265416695_Requirements_Fixation">academic paper</a> demonstrating the negative impacts of framing potential system functionality as &ldquo;requirements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For more information about the construction of preferences see <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/id/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/construction-preference">http://www.cambridge.org/id/academic/subjects/psychology/cognition/construction-preference</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why We Pair</h2>

<p>Hi. I have come to love Pair Programming. I enjoy the collaboration, cross-training, and better solutions that emerge while I pair.</p>

<p>Continuous Pair programming with Overlapping Pair Rotations removes knowledge silos to increase teams&#8217; resiliency to team disruption [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304014117_Sustainable_Software_Development_through_Overlapping_Pair_Rotation?ev=prf_high">reference</a>]  and builds collective code ownership [<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301612260_Practice_and_Perception_of_Team_Code_Ownership?ev=prf_high">reference</a>] as described in Sustainable Software Development.</p>

<p>Pair programming is a complex practice requiring skill to master. Although Pair Programming has been around for 20 years and is well researched, some teams simply drop engineers onto a team expecting them to figure Pair Programming out.</p>

<p>As a practitioner, I am still discovering ways that I can improve the pair programming dynamic.</p>

<p>This article describes 1) several techniques that can improve your pair programming experience, 2) strategies on what to do when things get frustrating or go wrong, and 3) concludes with success stories of converting difficult pair-programming relationships into successful pair-programming relationships.</p>

<p>Like any relationship, such as friendships, family dynamics, dating, or marriage, when pairing works well, it is an amazing experience; when pairing falls apart, it can be frustrating and occasionally super hurtful. While unfortunate dynamics can happen while pairing, I have experienced the joy of finding each other in the rift.</p>

<p>Pairing exposes both our strengths and our weakness. How we handle our weaknesses may have a direct impact on the pairing relationship. One of us might not be comfortable exposing our weaknesses. If we are experiencing imposter syndrome, feeling that we are not qualified for the job we have, we might fear that our partner is going to find out that we are faking it.</p>

<p>I have been on a journey to be a better pair. While at Pivotal over 3.5 years, I have paired with ~39 pivots and ~ 20 client developers. I am grateful to each person who has helped me better understand myself and have helped me assemble and create these techniques. If you paired with me and I did not apply the technique, it may be because I learned it later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Strategies for Success in Pair Programming</h2>

<p>In my software development practice, I rely on several techniques for increasing the probability of success with a pairing relationship.</p>

<p>This article contains a toolbox of techniques. Feel free to pick a few to try out and then revisit the list in a few weeks.</p>

<p><em>Become invested in your pair’s success</em> is the major take-away. When I am taking care of myself and looking out for my pair, an incredible friendship can form. Consider “what are my pairs strengths? And how do they map to my weaknesses?” and vice-versa. Have I <em>always</em> been invested in my pair&rsquo;s success? No. My pairs probably have stories on how I could have improved in my pairing. Shifting from “what is in it for me” to “what is in it for us” enables new pairing dynamics.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>When Pair Programming Goes Wrong / Weird</h2>

<p>Since pairing is a relational practice relying on imperfect communication, misunderstandings and slights can emerge.</p>

<p>What could go wrong with pairing?  Here are some situations that have bothered me.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You come across some code that is difficult to read. Your partner tells you not to refactor the code.</p></li>
<li><p>Your partner dominates the keyboard for most of the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Your partner does all the work without involving you.</p></li>
<li><p>Your partner tells you how horrible is the code that you helped work on the previous day.</p></li>
<li><p>You discuss a situation and agree to a plan, but then your partner starts doing his / her own thing anyway.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In this section, I list out several strategies for coping with a situation that is getting tense, de-escalating a situation that is tense, and how to re-engage with your partner after a tense situation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are several ways in which Sustainable Software Development has evolved from Extreme Programming (XP)</p>

<p>Sustainable Software Development</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>combines user centered design with agile software development</em>. Product designers apply design thinking and user research to understand what product and features to build. Extreme Programming relies on an onsite customer to tell the developers what to build. This is problematic in two ways. Often an onsite customer is unavailable, impractical, or too expensive to have on a team. Onsite customers are not trained in design thinking and information architecture.</li>
  <li><em>reduces the commitment level of the team to the work in progress</em>, the stories that each developer is currently working on. Unlike Extreme Programming, the team does not commit to an amount of work to be done during a weekly cycle or iteration. There are no iterations in Sustainable Software Development.</li>
  <li><em>focuses the technical practices on two main goals</em>
      <ol>
         <li>caretaking the code</li>
          <li>removing knowledge silos</li>
      </ol>
      Extreme Programming has many practices around improving code quality, but removing knowledge silos is not an explicit goal.
  </li>
  <li><em>replaces predictions with focusing on &#8220;what is the minimal that we need to ship?&#8221;</em> Planning Extreme Programming utilizes the team&#8217;s velocity and backlog to create burn down charts for forecasting the team&#8217;s progress. Like Extreme Programming, the team maintains a shippable product. 
  <li><em>identifies and removes software development waste</em>. Weekly retros identify wastes and the team removes wastes with action items and chores.   
</ul>


<p>Both Sustainable Software Development and Extreme Programming deal with the tension of dates and features by asking &ldquo;how do we reduce scope?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what should be done first?&rdquo; In other words, developer happiness and sustainability is achieved by prioritizing the work.</p>

<p>This table compares Sustainable Software Development to Extreme Programming (XP).</p>

        Make the customer a part of the team. “The point of customer involvement is to reduce wasted effort by putting the people with the needs in direct contact with the people who can fill those needs” [1]. Even if a customer is busy, involving them whenever possible is preferred to not involving them at all. In this situation, the team needs to find alternative ways of validating features with users.<br/>    
        It is impractical to have an onsite customer.

    <td><b>Test-First Programming</b>
        The developers write tests before writing code. Every production line of code is preceded by a test. Test-first programming addresses several concerns: scope-creep, coupling and cohesion, trust, and rhythm. The practice mitigates against scope-creep; without a clear goal, a programmer can easily write more code than is necessary. The practice improves coupling and cohesion as easy-to-test code often has beneficial design qualities. The practice builds trust in the code as engineers trust tested code more than un-tested code. The practice produces rhythm as it provides a cadence of accomplishing goals.

        <b>Single Code Base</b><sup>C</sup>
        Ideally there is only one branch of the code. Multiple branches, (e.g. for releases, or customers) creates extra work. Branches live a few hours at most.

    <td><b>Pair Programming</b>
        Every part of a production system is written by two programmers sitting side by side. The pair works together to solve problems, keep each other on task, learn from each other, and abide by the team’s practices.

<p><sup>C</sup> are optional XP 2.0 Corollary Practices</p>

<p>For a team transitioning to Extreme Programming, Beck recommends starting with the primary practices. Beck claims that “the primary practices are useful independent of what else you are doing” resulting in an immediate improvement, whereas the corollary practices work well once a team has implemented the primary practices. Extreme programming is not dogmatic about the list of practices. The team chooses which practices to apply.</p>

<p>Once a team has implemented the primary practices, then the team can start implementing the corollary practices. Beck says that it seems “difficult or dangerous to implement [the corollary practices] before completing the preliminary work of the primary practices” [1].</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are using Grounded Theory to conduct research in software engineering, I would love to hear from you. Please contact me at [professor at gmail.com]</p>

<p>If you are starting out on grounded theory research, I would suggest this plan of action:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine with variant of Grounded Theory that you want to use. Options include:

<ul>
<li>Classic / Glasserian grounded theory</li>
<li>Straussian grounded theory</li>
<li>Constuctivist grounded theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287491381_Grounded_Theory_in_Software_Engineering_Research_A_Critical_Review_and_Guidelines">Stol&rsquo;s comparison</a> of the three major variants and recommendations on how to write grounded theory research.</li>
<li>Read my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314081058_Lessons_Learned_from_an_Extended_Participant_Observation_Grounded_Theory_Study">lessons learned paper</a></li>
<li>Read a few exemplars (e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313360479_Software_Development_Waste">Software Development Waste</a>, <a href="https://rashinadotcom.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/hoda-becomingagile-icse2017-preprint.pdf">Becoming Agile</a>)</li>
<li>If you select Constructivist grounded theory, then read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0857029142/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0857029142&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sedano-20&amp;linkId=11734cd973c525d633fcfeeac3245f7b">Charmaz’s Constructing Grounded Theory</a></li>
<li>If you select Glasserian grounded theory, then read <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/460c/9e0abe4ad1127da6410c912656ddda67510c.pdf">Hoda&rsquo;s Grounded Theory for Geeks</a> and read Glaser&rsquo;s books in order.</li>
</ol>


<p>This month I finished my Ph.D. I have used grounded theory for the last three years. I have found the method extremely rewarding. I loved interviewing, participant observation, and analyzing the data. There will be moments of confusion with the data. Embrace the confusion, on the other side tends to rewarding research results.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We Know the Way &ndash; Phonetic Lyrics &ndash; Moana</p>

<p>Thank you Opetaia Foa&#8217;i for this fantastic song. It is my favorite
from the Moana sound track.</p>

<p>I wanted to learn this song, yet the official lyrics are in Samoan, Tokelauan, and English (I think). Since I only speak English, I created these phonetic lyrics.</p>

<p>I slowed the music to 70% normal speed and listened over and over again. Note, we might not have all the phonemes in English.</p>

<p>Ta-toe Ta-na-to-pho-low</p>

<p>Flah-ee-ow-ee-nah</p>

<p>Le&#8217;-tua-tsome knee-te-lay</p>

<p>A-ohm-my</p>

<p>Oo-ah-pah el-lay-lu-ah toa-le-eh</p>

<p>Ta-fi-na-fi-nigh</p>

<p>Oh-loh oh-loh tah-kah</p>

<p>Away Away</p>

<p>Ku-ku-en-new-ah</p>

<p>Te mah new lay lay A ta key A</p>

<p>Away Away</p>

<p>Tef-en-new-tim-mall-ee-A</p>

<p>Nah echo hockey lee-ah</p>

<p>Kah-ang nah-A</p>

<p>One of my hobbies is improv, and I play a game where we get our partner
to guess multi-syllabic words by acting out each phoneme.</p>
