<div class="entry-content"><p>There are several ways in which Sustainable Software Development has evolved from Extreme Programming (XP)</p>

<p>Sustainable Software Develpoment</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>combines user centered design with agile software development</em>. Product designers apply design thinking and user research to understand what product and features to build. Extreme Programming relies on an onsite customer to tell the developers what to build. This is problematic in two ways. Often an onsite customer is unaviable, impractical, or too expensive to have on a team. Onsite customers are not trained in design thinking and information architecture.</li>
  <li><em>reduces the commitment level of the team to the work in progress</em>, the stories that each developer is currently working on. Unlike Extrmee Programming, the team does not commit to an amount of work to be done during a weekly cycle or iteration. There are no iterations in Sustinable Software Development.</li>
  <li><em>focuses the technical practices on two main goals</em>
      <ol>
         <li>caretaking the code</li>
          <li>removing knowledge silos</li>
      </ol>
      Extreme Programming has many practices around improving code quality, but removing knowledge silos is not an explicit goal.
  </li>
  <li><em>replaces predictions with focusing on &#8220;what is the minimal that we need to ship?&#8221;</em> Planning Extreme Programming utilizes the team&#8217;s velocity and backlog to create burn down charts for forecasting the team&#8217;s progress. Like Extreme Progamming, the team maintains a shippable product. 
  <li><em>identifies and removes software development waste</em>. Weekly retros identify wastes and the team removes wastes with action items and chores.   
</ul>


<p>Both Sustainable Software Development and Extreme Programming deal with the tension of dates and features by asking &ldquo;how do we reduce scope?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what should be done first?&rdquo; In other words, developer happiness and sustainability is achieved by prioritizing the work.</p>

<p>This table compares Sustainable Software Development to Extreme Programming (XP). A more detailed analysis follows after the table.</p>

<p><sup>C</sup> are optional XP 2.0 Corollary Practices</p>

<p>For a team transitioning to Extreme Programming, Beck recommends starting with the primary practices. Beck claims that “the primary practices are useful independent of what else you are doing” resulting in an immediate improvement, whereas the corollary practices work well once a team has implemented the primary practices. Extreme programming is not dogmatic about the list of practices. The team chooses which practices to apply.</p>

<p>Once a team has implemented the primary practices, then the team can start implementing the corollary practices. Beck says that it seems “difficult or dangerous to implement [the corollary practices] before completing the preliminary work of the primary practices” [1].</p>

      Balanced Team</td>
    <td>Whole Team (Balanced Team)<br/>
        Whole team is also known as cross-functional teams. Include people on the team with the skills needed for success. Beck points out that a sense of team fulfills an individual’s psychological needs. “We belong. We are in this together. We support each others’ work, growth, and learning.” [1]

  <tr>
    <td class="ident">User research</td>
    <td><b>Real Customer Involvement</b><sup>C</sup> (On-site customer)
        Make the customer a part of the team. “The point of customer involve- ment is to reduce wasted effort by putting the people with the needs in direct contact with the people who can fill those needs” [1]. Even if a customer is busy, involving them whenever possible is preferred to not involving them at all. In this situation, the team needs to find alternative ways of validating features with users.<br/>    
        It is impractical to have an onsite customer.

    <td class="ident2">Clean code</td>
    <td><b>Code and Tests</b><sup>C</sup>
        The tests and code are the only permanent artifacts. Everything else (e.g. documentation) is generated from the code. Anything that contributes to what the system does today and what it will do tomorrow is valuable, “everything else is waste” [1].

    <td class="ident2">Fast test suite and builds</td>
    <td>Ten-minute Build<br/>
        Building the code and running the test suite should be automated and short. Longer builds increase the feedback loop.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ident2">Test Driven Development / BDD</td>
    <td>Test-First Programming<br/>
        The developers write tests before writing code. Every production line of code is preceded by a test. Test-first programming addresses several concerns: scope-creep, coupling and cohesion, trust, and rhythm. The practice mitigates against scope-creep; without a clear goal, a programmer can easily write more code than is necessary. The practice improves coupling and cohesion as easy-to-test code often has beneficial design qualities. The practice builds trust in the code as engineers trust tested code more than un-tested code. The practice produces rhythm as it provides a cadence of accomplishing goals.
     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ident2">Team code ownership</td>
    <td>Shared Code<sup>C</sup> (Collective ownership)<br/>
        Everyone on the team can modify any of the system. When engineers sees something broken, they fix it.<br/>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ident2"> Continuous refactoring</td>
    <td>Incremental Design (Simple Design Refactoring)<br/>
        Build the system incrementally and evolve the design every day. In the past, software teams might often had long design phases that assumed features would not change. When the team’s understanding of the system changes, make incremental changes to the system to align the code’s design with the team’s desired goal. Teams routinely remove duplication.
   </td>
  </tr>    
  <tr>
    <td class="ident2">Integrate frequently</td>
    <td><b>Continuous Integration</b>
        When working on new features, routinely integrate new code into the master code repository. Avoid long-lived branches. Beck suggests un-integrated code live on its own “no more than a couple of hours” [1]. The longer the team waits to integrate, the more unpredictable and expensive integration becomes.<br/> 
        <b>Single Code Base</b><sup>C</sup>
        Ideally there is only one branch of the code. Multiple branches, (e.g. for releases, or customers) creates extra work. Branches live a few hours at most.

During a meeting at the beginning of the week, the team reviews progress to date, the customer chooses a week’s worth of stories, and the engineers decompose the stories into tasks and individually estimate each task. “The goal is to have deployable software at the end of the week which everyone can celebrate as progress” [1].

        “Work only as many hours as you can be productive and only as many hours as you can sustain” [1]. Working longer hours may make the team less productive.

        Team Continuity<sup>C</sup><br/>
        “Keep effective teams together” [1]. People are not fungible, and building relation- ships is part of creating a high performing team. Rotating people through teams helps spread knowledge.
    </td>

    <td>Optional, depends on situation</td>

        Pay-per-use provides alignment between revenue and the features that generate the rev- enue. “Connecting money flow directly to software development provides accurate, timely information with which to drive improvement” [1].
